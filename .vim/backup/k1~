 In the P&O algo-
rithm, the operating voltage of the PV array is perturbed by a small increment, and the resulting change in
power, ÁP, is measured. If ÁP is positive, then the perturbation of the operating voltage moved the PV array’s
operating point closer to the MPP. Thus, further voltage perturbations in the same direction (that is, with the
same algebraic sign) should move the operating point toward the MPP. If ÁP is negative, the system operating
point has moved away from the MPP, and the algebraic sign of the perturbation should be reversed to move back
toward the MPP.
