# purpose:   read a pipe-delimited text file (i.e., the "fields" are separated by
#            the "|" character
# usage:     perl read-pipe-file.pl

# a sample record looks like this: 
# field1 data | field2 data | field 3 | and so on ...

$filename = 'dump1';

# use the perl open function to open the file
open(FILE, $filename) or die "Could not read from $filename, program halting.";

# loop through each line in the file
# with the typical "perl file while" loop
while(<FILE>)
{
  # get rid of the pesky newline character
  chomp;

  # read the fields in the current line into an array
  @fields = split(':', $_);

  # print the first field
  print "$fields[0]\n";
}
close FILE;
